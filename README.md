# DiffusionFEM

Internal finite element code using Fenics. Disclaimer: I really don't know what I'm doing :)

## DiffFConc.py

This code is meant to capture a non-constant diffusivity (diffusivity that is a function of concentration). The boundary conditions are setup to be a 2D recreation of my experiments. Here, we are modeling the diffusion of an element (e.g. ZrO2) in model silicate melts.
